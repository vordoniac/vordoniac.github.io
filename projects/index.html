Alright so - I made a java 				file that takes three points in 3d space, interprets it as a triangle 				in 3d space, and splits this triangle into isosceles triangles, and outputs the points of those triangles. 				If you didn't know, any irregular triangle can be split into at least 4 isosceles 				triangles, and any right triangle can be split into at least 2. Of course, because <i>that</i> wasn't				enough, I then made an <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/" class="link" target="_blank">AutoHotkey</a> file and programmed it to be able to output the XYZ-translation, X-scaling, 				Y-scaling, X-axis rotation, Y-axis rotation, and Z-axis rotation values needed to map equilateral triangles				to reconstruct a triangulated (have all it's faces made triangles) 3D model given the points of all of it's 				triangles by splitting each irregular triangle into isosceles triangles and mapping those equilateral 				triangles to them (because you can scale any equilateral triangle to any isosceles triangle if you have independent				control of X and Y scaling). This means that if you have a 3D editor of some kind, and you are able to get an				equilateral triangle and also be able to modify those specific values, you could reconstruct any 3D-model despite any limitations the 3D editor has. 				Really, every part of this is complicated and it scares me that this is what I find fun and do with my free time.				</p>				<ul>					<li>						<a href="projects/Triangle.java" class="download" target="_blank">JAVA TRIANGLE</a> [few comments because that's just how I do things :)]					</li>					<li>						<a href="projects/TrianglesAutoHotKey.ahk" class="download" target="_blank">AHK TRIANGLE</a> [some comments to help navigate the crazy stuff I do]					</li>					<li>						<a href="projects/PythonCodeForBlender.txt" class="download" target="_blank">BLENDER TO AHK READABLE PYTHON SCRIPT</a> [converts the selected object in Blender into the 						txt file the AHK TRIANGLE script can read]					</li>				</ul>			</td>		</tr>	</table>	<br>	<table class="tablebg">		<tr>			<th>				<b>= Tetris Baloney =</b>			</th>		</tr>		<tr>			<td>				<center><img src="tetris.png" width="600px" class="img"></center><br>				<p>				First, you've got to understand that in the making of this, me and my friend had a time limit. We chose to make 				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris" class="link" target="_blank">Tetris</a> as our programming project for our Computer Science A class. We thought it would be of moderate challenge and fun to do. 				<br><br>				Well... it was fun. 				<br><br>				...				<br><br>				I mean, in the end we had a product that was functional, but I'd say that I ended up doing a whole <i>lot</i> more work than				I would have ever thought Tetris would need; I guess I can't really speak for my friend on that though. But, to be fair to my workload 				, we did a lot more than most people do when making Tetris. For example, most of the time when people code Tetris they don't				include wall kicks, they have the piece stick to the bottom the second it touches the bottom, they pick the pieces completely randomly 				instead of using a bag randomizer like in the real game, they don't include the points for T-spins or T-spin minis (professional 				Tetris moves that, while obscure, award their own points), sometimes they don't even include the hold feature, and many times the product is				just the result of them watching some lame YouTube tutorial. Of course, the Tetris we made had none of those problems, and we				just went off of the <a href="http://harddrop.com/wiki/Tetris_Wiki" class="link" target="_blank">HardDrop wiki</a> and played the <a href="https://tetris.com/play-tetris" class="link" target="_blank">online version</a> 				a zillion times to figure out how to actually program the game correctly. Oh yeah, dying. In our version, death is less of a "Game Over" and more like a 				"Game You Really Can't Do Anything Anymore". Like, the Tetris pieces just spawn in each other and you can't really move them so you just have to accept the score you 				have at that point and close the game. Here's where the time limit we had kind of shows. The not working menu buttons. The bad looking graphics. The weird first time you use the "hold" box. The fact that all the pieces are flipped 				in the "hold" box and in the "next" box. Look, I know it's not perfect, but the last thing I ever want to do is go back and try to understand 				our minamally commented code. Also, everything is programmed in <a href="https://processing.org/" class="link" target="_blank">Processing</a> because that was the "thing" in our CompSci class at the time. 				You know what I mean, I think.				</p>				<ul>					<li>						<a href="projects/TetrisBaloney.zip" class="download">TETRIS STUFF DOWNLOAD</a>					</li>				</ul>			</td>		</tr>	</table>	<br>	<table class="tablebg">		<tr>			<th>				<b>= Grammar Overload =</b>			</th>		</tr>		<tr>			<td>				<center><img src="wordmap2.png" class="img"></center><br>				<p>				This is probably one of the biggest works.

All together, 				this took about 3 months of work, but considering I had not much time every day because of school, that's 				probably why it took so long. Still though, I'm very happy with it. I would sometimes tell people at school 				I was doing this and they would ask "Why though?" My answer often went something like "Because it's fun!" 				This was true, but why was it fun? I think it was because I was looking into a subject that we all think we 				know intuitivly and finding out some of the crazy rules that actually exist and go against or with inutition. Also 				because it hadn't been done before. Also because it was just fun. Yeah. [Fun Fact: There are 12 rules for commas. 7 				of which have an exception. 2 of those exeptions have an exception.

I <i>really</i> do want to learn it though. I 				come up with so many cool ideas that I want to pursue, but it always seemed that my limited ability to work with the three dimensional math prevented a sizable fraction of those ideas from 				being feasible until I expanded that ability. This was an attempt to do that. No, I haven't given up on it yet, not at all. Actually, I am currently (7/19/2019) working on something that				is supposed to make this, along with many other things, much easier to deal with. Anyway, that's what this is: a nearly functional minimal 3D renderer in java. 				I doubt you would want to actually mess with the code yourself though, but I'll put it here just to remain consistent.				</p>				<ul>					<li>						<a href="projects/3dRenderer.zip" class="download">ATTEMPT AT A 3D RENDERER JAVA FILES DOWNLOAD</a>					</li>				</ul>			</td>		</tr>	</table>	<br>	<table class="tablebg">		<tr>			<th>				<b>= This Website =</b>			</th>		</tr>		<tr>			<td>				<center><img src="website.png" width="600px" class="img"></center><br>				<p>				Look, this website took a lot of work to do, so I think it deserves a spot on the projects section.
